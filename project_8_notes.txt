🟢 Sliding Window Pattern
🟡 Definition
- Sliding windows start from the first element and keep shifting right by one element and adjust the length of the window according
to the problem
🟡 Coding problems
- Maximum Subarray ✅
- Minimum Size Subarray Sum ✅
- Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters ✅
🟡 Resources


🟢 To-do list
- learn each pattern and like do 2 problems from that pattern
- then finish your DSA and just think about which pattern is in each

🟢 Thoughts
- should i just do brute force first? helped on #2
- i realy think its important for me to not look at solutions without AT LEAST figuring out the brute force
- don't just use for loops....use while loops
- redo minimum size subarray sum with binary search
- maybe its smart to use graph paper with coding problems
- THE DEBUGGER IN LEETCODE IS SO HELPFUL OMG
- is the map in js an ordered dictionary
- i think as long as you are doing 1-2 coding problems daily u r good
- a really big part of being good at these questions is coming up with good test cases

🟢 Info 
🟡 Sliding Window Pattern
- Sliding windows start from the first elemtn and keep shifting right by one element and adjust the length of the window according
to the problem
- in some problems the window remains cosntant and in some it grows and shrinks
- usually longest/shortest substring, substring, or desired value are common problems
🟡 Difference between sliding window and 2 pointers
- Sliding window algorithms can be implemented with a single pointer and a variable for window size. Typically we use all of the elements within the window for the problem (for eg - sum of all elements in the window).
- Two pointer technique is quite similar but we usually compare the value at the two pointers instead of all the elements between the pointers.
- Two pointers can also have variations like fast-slow pointer.
🟡 let vs var vs const 
- var is globally scoped (on a whole window of code when not in a function)
    - when declared inside a function it is locally scoped
    - var variables can be re-declared and updated. This is a problem when you forget that you already declared a variable
    - var is hoisted to the top of your code and initialized as undefined (unless a value is asigned).
    Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
- let is scoped within whatever brackets it is in {}
    - it is the preffered variable declaration
    - can be updated, but not re-declared
    - Just like  var, let declarations are hoisted to the top. Unlike var which is initialized as undefined, 
    the let keyword is not initialized. So if you try to use a let variable before declaration, you'll get a Reference Error.
- Variables declared with the const maintain constant values
    - const cannot be updated or redeclared
    - also work based on bracket access like let. it is also hoisted like let
    - the behavior is different when it comes to objects made with const
    - the properties of a const object can be updated
